The original dataset was pre-processed to downscale all images to 64x64 pixels and cropped to the centre of the image. All images are uint8 datatype. A training and test set were selected to balance the labels. A training and test set were selected to balance the labels. There are a total of 56,259 training examples of 10,800 test examples.

There are 12 images classes, which use integer labels of [0, 1, 2, â€¦, 10, 11]. The meaning of the labels is described below.

label_map = {
    0: "bike",
