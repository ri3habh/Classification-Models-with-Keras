# Classification-Models-with-Keras
A variety of classification models made with Keras, mostly for the Fall 2023 Open Project, Hosted by the Wat.ai Design Team from UWaterloo. All models try to classify images from the Stanford Online Products Dataset (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/stanford_online_products).

Ultimately, I got 1st place for the Classical ML model for Binary Classification and 2nd place for the Deep Learning Multiclass model (10 types of products).
